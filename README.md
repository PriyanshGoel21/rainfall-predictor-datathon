# Rainfall Prediction using Random Forest
This project was developed as part of a hackathon and aims to predict rainfall using the Random Forest algorithm. The project utilizes historical weather data to train a Random Forest model, which can then be used to predict rainfall in a given region.

## Features
**Data Preprocessing:** The collected weather data is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize data, and extract relevant features for training the Random Forest model.

**Random Forest Model:** The project utilizes the Random Forest algorithm, which is an ensemble learning method, to train a prediction model. This model is capable of handling both regression and classification tasks for rainfall prediction.

**Model Evaluation:** The trained Random Forest model is evaluated using various performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess its effectiveness in predicting rainfall.

**Model Deployment:** The project includes the deployment of the trained Random Forest model using streamlit, allowing users to input weather data for prediction and obtain rainfall predictions in real-time.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python packages using pip or conda package manager. For example:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
Usage
Run the data collection script to collect and preprocess historical weather data.
Train the Random Forest model using the preprocessed data.
Evaluate the model's performance using various performance metrics.
Deploy the trained model to make rainfall predictions based on user input.
For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the documentation included in the repository.
