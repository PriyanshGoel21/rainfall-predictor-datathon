# Rainfall Prediction using Random Forest
This project was developed as part of a hackathon and aims to predict rainfall using the Random Forest algorithm. The project utilizes historical weather data to train a Random Forest model, which can then be used to predict rainfall in a given region.

**Project URL:** https://rainfall-prediction-sigfest.streamlit.app/

## Features
**Data Preprocessing:** The collected weather data is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize data, and extract relevant features for training the Random Forest model.

**Random Forest Model:** The project utilizes the Random Forest algorithm, which is an ensemble learning method, to train a prediction model. This model is capable of handling both regression and classification tasks for rainfall prediction.

**Model Evaluation:** The trained Random Forest model is evaluated using various performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess its effectiveness in predicting rainfall.

**Model Deployment:** The project includes the deployment of the trained Random Forest model using streamlit, allowing users to input weather data for prediction and obtain rainfall predictions in real-time.
